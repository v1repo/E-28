  <h1>Hello &#128075; from Vinod</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone!</p>
  <p>My name is Vinod. I grew up in India, currently living in USA and still growing.
  <br>
  I studied <strong>Computer Science</strong> as my major. I have worked as backend developer & moved to front-end engineer before full stack developer became a thing.
  And now I am focused on Accessibility and collaborate with developers, designers and QA testers to make accessible software.
