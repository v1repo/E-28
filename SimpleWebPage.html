  <h1>Hello World &#128075;</h1>
  <p>My name is Vinod. I grew up in India, currently living in USA and <em>still growing</em>.
  <br><br>
  I studied <strong>Computer Science</strong> as my major. I have worked as backend developer & moved to front-end engineer before full stack developer became a thing.
  And now I am focused on Accessibility and collaborate with developers, designers and QA testers to make accessible software.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was initially interested in the course "Developing Websites with Wordpress" but the course is offered in Fall semester.
    And I was aware of the popularity of Single-page Web Apps. The course content focuses on the fundamentals on web development
    and we will learn React along the way. All these factors made me switch my interest to this course.

  <h2>My Quiet Place</h2>
  <p>Often I like to walk around this place to get some quiet time and think deeply</p>
